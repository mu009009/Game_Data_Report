                      The map and the line chart show the gdp change and game sales data from 2007 to 2017. In these 11 years, only in 2009, there is a negative gdp growth.<br>

                      <br>

                      However, the game sales seems not influenced by growth or crisis of the finance. What's worse, after 2010 finance goes better year by year, but the game marketing seems smaller and smaller.<br>

                      <br>

                      Generally, I assume that this is because of the smartphone games marketing influence people's choice.

                  Generally, shows the data that how the financial situation changes from 2007 to 2017, we can see that the finance goes up year by year, except 2009, but the game marketing going smaller and smaller.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  This may be influenced by the game marketing of smartphone, and also maybe by the movie career and other entertainment careers. People have more and more choice on spending their spare time, but whatever how the game marketing worse is, there is still a lot of companies hold their positions in this field. The next part will show the transcripts from game companies, they will categories based on their base areas.

                      From the two bar chart we could see that most of the game can not do a good sell for over 1 year, there are 1172 games in the Europe data, and 65.53% of them can only sell for 1 year, only 3.1% of games can stay the top 100 sales list for over 3 years. The USA has offered a similar answer, 66.27% of 1168 games stay less than 1 year, and 3.34% of games run a long term round. As for Japan, the situation has become more extreme，79.73% of 1184 games in the less than 1-year category, and only 2.20% of games can sell more than 3 years.<br>
                      <br>

                      However, even the number of the game can stay on the top-selling list is very limited, but they really do impressive works on marketing. In Europe and USA, a game on the list over 3 years will sell more than 410 copies per week. But for those less than 1 year, they have only around 50 copies per week, there are 8 times of selling here.<br>
                      <br>

                      While the interesting thing here is that Japan has a different answer. The game sale around 2 - 3 years has the best average sales, it seems that people there prefer the new game.<br>
                      <br>


                      On the other hand, all of the data areas show the pattern that the game in the less than 1-year category and 1 - 2 years has a similar sale. Thus, it seems that we could assume that generally, for most of the games, have only around 2-year life cycle. After that, they are selling will go down, only very limited games can have a long life, and they all do super well.<br>
                      
                      <br>
                      In addition, combine the two line chart above, we could figure out that the total number of game copy sales in Japan should less than Europe and USA area. In the record, Japan does not have too many games on the list, but the weekly average sales are much smaller than the other two country areas.

                      However, the data in the sales map part and the data in the weekly sales analysis part both show that the game market is different in different countries.<br>

                      Especially the market in Japan, it is a dying market. But, the Japan Enterprise give a different answer.<br>
                      <br>
                      
                      At first, the number of Japanese Game Enterprise is similar to the Game Enterprise based in USA, both has around 195 companies, and about 30 more comapnies than the Europe Area.<br>
                      <br>
                      
                      Besides, Japanese companies also have sold as much as USA companies did in the past years and more than the sum of Europe's.<br>
                      <br>
                      
                      And the Japanese company, Nintendo has sold the most game copies, 625.4 million of copies, as about the top in Europe, Electronic Arts have done 602.6, while the top in the USA, Activision has only done 504.7 million copies sales. <br>
                      <br>
                      
                      Thus I got the conclusion that in fact, the Japanese Companies did a good job according to the past time, and they should have a global strategy. Cause their target users of their products are from all over the world, and they are competing in the same global game market, this can explain why those Japanese Companies still do the similar sale as the western companies did, while their own game marketing is decreasing.<br>

                      Generally Speaking, based on the GDP change data, game marketing data, game sales data, and the game publisher sales data, we could see that for the different area, the game market and games sales has a lot of different.<br>
                      <br>
                      
                      Japan has become the smallest market all over the world, and the USA and Europe have the similar size of the game market.<br>
                      <br>
                      
                      But, the game companies target the market as a whole global market, and this reduces the difference between game publishers.<br>
                      <br>
                      
                      This can also somehow explain that the game market does not influence by the GDP too much, cause the publisher in this market is more influenced by the global preference, but not the preference or consumption habits from one country area.<br>
                      <br>
                      
                      What's more, this also leaves the inspiration, that if a publisher would like to join this market, it is wise to use a global strategy to develop their companies. And if they have sufficient resource, it is better to design a game for long term market round, this benefit much more than those games has only a short life.
